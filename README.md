 # EncryptDecrypt
  
  EncryptDecrypt is a Java application that allows you to easily encrypt and decrypt text files using the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) symmetric key encryption algorithm with PKCS5Padding padding. With this tool, you can protect sensitive data during transfer or storage on disk.
  
  ## Usage
  
  To use EncryptDecrypt, simply launch the application and follow the instructions on the screen. You will be asked to enter the desired encryption key and then you can choose to encrypt or decrypt a text file.
  
  Note: it is important to use the same encryption key that was used during encryption during decryption. If you use a different key, errors may occur during decryption.
  
  ## Requirements
  
  To run EncryptDecrypt, you need to have Java 8 or higher installed on your system.
